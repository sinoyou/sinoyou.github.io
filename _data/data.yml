    title: Introduction
    summary: |
      I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Technology at School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University. I currently work as a research intern, advised by [Prof. Keqiang Li](http://www.dae.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/daeen/4370/2011/20110420085553864426792/20110420085553864426792_.html), at the Lab of Intelligent and Connected Vehicles. 
      
        - **Research Interest:** To broaden my horizon and gain systematic professional training, I am broadly interested in both the theoretical and applied areas of **Artificial Intelligence**, particularly in **Computer Vision** and **Robotics**. 

        - **Current Research:** My current research is the visual perception of intelligent vehicles. My goal is to design learning-based methods to predict movements of vulnerable road users more accurately and reliably. I also work on explainable AI and improve deep learning models for their better application on the system level.
